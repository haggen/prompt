<center>![Prompt for zsh](screenshot.png)</center>

---

This is my custom zsh prompt.

- No framework dependency (oh-my-zsh, prezto, etc).
- Minimalistic but fast and a small profile.
- Displays elapsed time after command execution.
- Appends a mark for when your Git repository has untracked files or unstaged changes, or is ahead or behind remote.
